# Analysis of CO₂ Emissions in Italy (1990–2023)

## Project overview

This project analyzes Italy’s CO₂ emission trends using official data from  
ISPRA (Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research),  
the national authority responsible for greenhouse gas inventories. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate skills in data wrangling and visualization using real-world datasets. 

The analysis covers:
- data extraction and cleaning from raw Excel inventories  
- construction of reproducible datasets (CSV)  
- visualization of national emission trends with and without LULUCF  
- sector-level analysis through pivot tables and stacked charts

The full datasets are available in:  
`data_processed/policies.csv`  
`data_processed/co2_emissions_all_years.csv.csv`
